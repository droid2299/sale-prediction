# Grocery Sale Time Predictions using Time Series Analysis
Our application analyzes monthly costs of food and other miscellaneous goods, and predicts the price of each item in the following month. It utilizes food price data from the Government of Canada[1], dating back from 1991, and trains it using a SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict the price in the next month.
